------------------------NEW------------------------

set offset to 0, run turn motor to 0 and drive to full

turn motor so that if motor was driving, it would be driving forward

set that position as offset.

if things fuck up, make sure that falcon ticks and cancoder ticks move in the same direction when wheel is tured 

if they move in the opposite direction, flip only falcon motor

if that doesnt work, flip only cancoder

if that doesnt work, flip both

if that doesnt work, try old way

---------------------------------------------------




------------------------OLD------------------------

set offset to 0, turn motor ccw, set offset

if it doesnt work, set offset back to zero, turn motor cw, set offset,

if works, redeploy code and test if it works, then turn robot on and 
off and re deploy to test if it works

DONT INVERT CANCODER OR DRIVING WHEEL UNLESS NOTHING WORKS
